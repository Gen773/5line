Gomoku with a few additional gimmick elements

1. The winner is the first player to arrange 5 pieces vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
2. However, due to gravity, pieces can only be placed at the bottom of the row.
3. Instead of placing pieces, the field can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise.
4. If five pieces are placed at the same time, points may be awarded according to the number of pieces placed and the number of rows.
5. In case of a tie, the game is a tie.
